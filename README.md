# Hyst

## Goal 
Hyst is a library that is being made primarly for studies and for some basic projects i have in mind.
It's focus is on, first of all, studies, but as well as being an eye-candy library which pretends to be primarly structured as a tree.
The layout is pretended to not use any kind of 'raw' value, like positioning data at '50px 50px', but instead use taffy to make those calculations.

## Todo

There are a lot of stuff to do yet(not ordered):
  * Reimplement how elements are drawn(draw only where required and make less draw calls). [x]
  * Elements such as buttons, inputs, dialogs, etc. [x]
  * Animations. [x]
  * Implement elements to know what Pulses asked for updates. [x]
  * Make a styling-system Iced-like. [x]
  * Implement effects such as blur, constrast, hue, etc. [x]
  * Write examples. [x]
  * Implement parent/children system really functional.
  * Think if would be worthy writing something for 3D

## About development

Doing this library is being hard as hell, but i actually like it. Im not used to do graphics stuff, so I really have to learn about a lot of stuff while writing the lib,
so don't expect anything extremelly well thought, fast, and usable.
Maybe you would like to use it for some hobby-projects but DO NOT use it for anything serious
